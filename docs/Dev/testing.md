# Running tests

To confirm if costumy is working, you can execute the scripts located in `costumy/tests`.
If you get nothing or an error (not a warning), then costumy is not working perfectly.

- `test_classes.py` validates basic methods from various `costumy.classes`
- `test_designs.py` validates that designs from freesewing can be created
- `test_simulation.py` validates that a pattern can be converted into a mesh and simulated with blender.
